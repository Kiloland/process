This document is part of the specification of the free silicon manufacturing standard for manufacturing the LibreSilicon standard logic cells\footnote{\url{https://git.libresilicon.com/?p=redmine/standard-cell-lib.git;a=summary}} and related free technology nodes from the LibreSilicon project.

For this initial revision 0.1 a gate-first approach has been chosen which led to the choice of polysilicon as the gate electrode material because of the simplicity of the gate alignment.
For better isolation properties of the transistors and gates in overall a box-isolation approach has been chosen.
All of these choices have been made with the future scale down from the recent $1 \mu m$ to smaller structure sizes.
\textbf{This process is for manufacturing $1 \mu m$ only!}
But further releases which will have been tested with smaller structure sizes can be expected.
