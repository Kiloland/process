\subsection{N-well}\label{nwell_chapter}
In order to build CMOS on the same substrate, an N-well is required for building the complementary P-channel transistor for a NFET+PFET logic circuitry.

The cross section as well as the top view of the targeted geometry are shown in \autoref{nwell_target}

The N-well will serve us as an island of N-doped substrate within the P-doped basis substrate.

The P-dopant concentration of our prime grade, p-type, single side polished, four inch wafers is between $8.76 \cdot 10^{14} \frac{1}{cm^3}$ and $5.23 \cdot 10^{14} \frac{1}{cm^3}$

This means we need a dose of $2.33\times10^{12}cm^{-2}$ Phosphorus at 70 keV.

The concentration will need adjustment when the used substrate has different properties!
