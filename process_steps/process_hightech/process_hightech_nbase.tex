\subsection{N-base}\label{nbase_chapter}
In order to build BiCMOS on the same substrate, another N-well within the P-Base (tripple well!) is required for building the complementary isolated P-channel transistor for a n-p-channel logic circuitry as shown above in the example section.

The cross section as well as the top view of the targeted geometry are shown in \autoref{nbase_target}

\end{figure}

The N-well will serve us as an island of N-doped substrate within the P-doped basis substrate.

The dopant dose will be $2.33\times10^{12}cm^{-2}$ at 70 keV.
