\subsection{Metal 2}\label{chapter_metal2}

Now we've got to build the more interconnect wires, connecting the "metal1" to the "metal2" wires,
which will provide a way to contact to them with the via2 contact layout.

\end{figure}

As can be seen in \autoref{metal2_target}, the goal of this step is purely to etch the wire structure for the additional
metal layer into the in \autoref{metal1_target} deposited metal layer, and form wires by doing so.

In a later iterations of this process we might be switching to Copper as the metal2 material for this step which
will result in a variation of this step because the usage of damascene method.

For now first we sputter 100nm Aluminum and then around 50nm Nickel for passivation, all in the same vacuum.
