\subsection{Metal 2}\label{chapter_metal2}
Now we've got to build the more interconnect wires, connecting the contact vias to the "metal2" wires, which will provide a way to contact to them with the via2 contact layout.

	\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 3cm, auto, thick,scale=\CrossAndTopSectionBig, every node/.style={transform shape}]

	\end{tikzpicture}

	\label{metal2_target}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in \autoref{metal2_target}, the goal of this step is purely to etch the wire structure for the additional metal layer into the in \autoref{metal2_deposition} deposited metal layer, and form wires by doing so.

In later iterations of this process we might be switching to Tungsten as the metal material for this step so the etching method might change in further releases.
