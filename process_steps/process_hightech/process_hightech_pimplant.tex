\subsection{p+ Implant}\label{pimplant_chapter}
For the bulk of the NMOS transistors and for the source and drain of the PMOS transistors highly doped  p+ areas are required.
In this step we're going to build these.

	\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 3cm, auto, thick,scale=\CrossAndTopSectionBig, every node/.style={transform shape}]
		\input{tikz_process_steps/pimplant.a.tex}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 3cm, auto, thick,scale=\CrossAndTopSectionBig, every node/.style={transform shape}]
		\input{tikz_process_steps/pimplant.b.tex}
	\end{tikzpicture}

\end{figure}

The tricky thing here is to have a reasonable implant depth but not too deep because the deeper the junction, the higher the junction capacity which in turn limits the switching performance of the CMOS circuitry.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance =1cm, auto, thick,scale=\VLSILayout, every node/.style={transform shape}]
		\input{tikz_process_steps/pimplant.layout.tex}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{P+ layout}
	\label{pimplant_layout}
\end{figure}

An example layout of p-implants can be seen in \autoref{pimplant_layout}, the mask is being extracted from the layer "p\_plus\_select"

Also important to notice is that this example layout is just for demonstration purposes only, please have a look at the standard cell documentation for the actual layouts. 

The pselect is implanted with a Boron ($B^{11}$) dose of $2.5\times10^{12}cm^{-2}$ at an energy of 20 keV  (43nm$\pm$18nm deep)
