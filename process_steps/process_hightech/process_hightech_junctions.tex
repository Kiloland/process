\section{Junction implants}\label{junctions_chapter}

After we've etches the gate structures and have implemented the implant stop structures we perform the junction implants in \autoref{pimplant_chapter} and \autoref{nimplant_chapter}.

Thanks to the implant stop mask we have a nice control over channel lenghts because the implant stop structure compensates for alignment issues, which is crucial for Polysilicon diodes for instance.

After implantation we have to drive in the shallow junction implants in order to form the pn-junctions in the polysilicon gates and to increase the depth of the junctions
to a degree so that it won't be fully consumed during the silicide formation(\autoref{step_silicification}) step later on.

After we've implanted the Boron and Phosphorus, we will drive the whole thing in for 30 minutes at 900\degreesC and at the same time oxidize it with $O_2$ (dry oxidation) so that we can form the pad
oxide needed to deposit the nitride for the side wall spacers later on in \autoref{nitride_spacers_deposition}.
