\section{Interconnect}

Now that we've built all the devices, we've got to put wires on them in order to make them do something useful.

	\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 3cm, auto, thick,scale=\CrossSectionOnly, every node/.style={transform shape}]

	\label{inteconnect_cross_section}
\end{figure}

From here on it's basically just always the same game:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Deposit roughly 150nm LTO/PSG
	\item Etch vias
	\item Sputter metal
	\item Etch wires
	\item Go to 1
\end{enumerate}

As can be seen in \autoref{inteconnect_cross_section}

We have the holes where we sputter the metal into. All the oxide holes which are \autoref{chapter_contact}, \autoref{chapter_via1}, \autoref{chapter_via2} and \autoref{chapter_glass}, are basically the same.
We deposit 150nm LTO/PSG and etch holes into it, in order to contact through to the lower layer.
For the first layer, the etch stop is silicide, for the other layers it's the Nickel passivation.
