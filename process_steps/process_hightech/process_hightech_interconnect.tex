\section{Interconnect}

Now that we've built all the devices, we've got to put wires on them in order to make them do something useful.

\end{figure}

From here on it's basically just always the same game:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Deposit roughly 150nm LTO/PSG
	\item Etch vias
	\item Sputter metal
	\item Etch wires
	\item Go to 1
\end{enumerate}

As can be seen in \autoref{inteconnect_cross_section}

We have the holes where we sputter the metal into.
All the oxide holes which are \autoref{chapter_contact}, \autoref{chapter_via1}, \autoref{chapter_via2} and \autoref{chapter_glass}, are basically the same,
except that the glass layer is the top oxide opening and doesn't get any more metal sputtered on it.

We deposit 150nm LTO/PSG and etch holes into it, in order to contact through to the lower layer.

For the first metal layer (\autoref{chapter_metal1}), the etch stop is silicide and we have to sputter Nickel, as a diffusion barrier, before we sputter any Aluminum,
because the $Ti Si_2$ would react with the Aluminum to an high resistivity material.

For simplicity reasons Nickel has been chosen as the passivation material on top of the Aluminum as well, because then we have less different sputter sources.

For the other two layers, \autoref{chapter_metal2} and \autoref{chapter_metal3}, it's only the Aluminum and then the Nickel passivation.

Argon plasma etching with 5\% Chlorine gas added, with an output power of 500 Watts or more has been prooven very effective, for etching Nickel and Aluminium alike.

For the oxide hole etching, any oxide etching machine can be used, or one could even use just buffered oxide etchant (BOE).
