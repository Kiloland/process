\subsection{Metal 1}\label{chapter_metal1}

Now we've got to build the first interconnect wires, connecting the contact vias to the "metal1" wires, which will provide a way to contact to them with the via1 contact layout.

\end{figure}

In later iterations of this process we might be switching to Tungsten as the metal material for this step so the etching method might change in further releases.

First we sputter around 50nm Nickel, then 100nm Aluminum and at the end again around 50nm Nickel for passivation, all in the same vacuum.
