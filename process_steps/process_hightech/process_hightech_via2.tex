\subsection{Via 2}\label{chapter_via2}

Now we have to build an additional set of via1. connecting the first metal layer to the next metal layer.
These via1. are already part of the front-end process.

\end{figure}

As can be seen in \autoref{via2_cross_section}, the goal of this step is purely to deposit a layer of isolation oxide, get the holes into it, down to the metal layer below in order to form wires later on.

In a later iterations of this process we might be switching to Copper as the metal material for this step which will result in a variation of this step because the usage of damascene method.
