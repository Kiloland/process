\section{Tripple Well}\label{tripple_well_chapter}

In order to build BiCMOS on the same substrate, another N-well within the P-Base (tripple well!) is required for building the complementary isolated P-channel transistor for a n-p-channel logic circuitry as shown above in the example section.

The cross section as well as the top view of the targeted geometry are shown in \autoref{nbase_target}
