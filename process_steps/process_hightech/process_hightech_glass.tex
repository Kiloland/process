\subsection{Glass}\label{chapter_glass}

Now we have to build an additional set of via1. connecting the first metal layer to the next metal layer.

These via1. are already part of the front-end process.

\end{figure}

As can be seen in \autoref{via1.cross_subsections}, the goal of this step is purely to deposit a layer of isolation oxide,
get the holes into it, down to the metal layer below in order to form wires later on.

In a later iterations of this process we might be switching to Copper as the metal material for this step which will
result in a variation of this step because the usage of damascene method.
