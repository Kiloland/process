\subsection{Glass}\label{chapter_glass}

This is the final oxide layer, which serves as a passivation for the metal3 wires and exposes the bonding and test pads
to the outside world.

As can be seen in \autoref{glass_cross_sections}, the goal of this step is purely to deposit a layer of isolation oxide,
get the holes into it, down to the metal layer below in order to form wires later on.

In a later iterations of this process we might be switching to Copper as the metal material for this step which will
result in a variation of this step because the usage of damascene method.
