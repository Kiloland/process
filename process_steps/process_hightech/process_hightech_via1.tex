\subsection{Via 1}\label{chapter_via1}

Now we have to build an additional set of vias connecting the first metal layer to the next metal layer.

Those vias are already part of the front-end process.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 3cm, auto, thick,scale=\CrossSectionOnly, every node/.style={transform shape}]
		\input{tikz_process_steps/via1.a.tex}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Contact geometry target}
	\label{via1_cross_section}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in \autoref{via1_cross_section}, the goal of this step is purely to deposit a layer of isolation oxide,
get the holes into it, down to the metal1 layer below in order to form wires later on.
