\section{Shallow trench isolation}\label{sti_chapter}
The geometry of a substrate with STI implemented can be seen in \autoref{sti_target}.

As can be seen in \autoref{tripple_well_target}, the N-well and the STI trench are supposed to have approximately the same depth but the N-well and P-well go down a little bit further.

Because the N-well will be $\approx 4 \mu m$ in depth we have to match this with our trench depth.

I order to allow a sufficiently low resistance of the ESD diode but at the same time a sufficient isolation of between the standard cells a trade-off has been done.

The targeted depth of the box isolation is $\approx 4 \mu m$.

The STI area will be everywhere, where no well areas are.

We use a dry etching method for cutting into the silicon substrate and making the active area become islands with trenches in between.

After that we fill the trenches with LTO or PSG and polish the wafer until the LTO/PSG surface and the silicon island surface are sufficiently on the same level.

Our minimum width and height as well as the space between the active areas comes from the line space constrain of the silicon etcher and of course the optical limitations of the stepper which are as well 0.5\um.

\subsection{Silicon etching}\label{sti_trench_etch}

The trench depth has to be at least 4.5 microns deep, in order to compensate for sacrificial silicon polishing during the later CMP steps.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 3cm, auto, thick,scale=\CrossSectionOnly, every node/.style={transform shape}]
		\input{tikz_process_steps/sti.silicon_etch.a.tex}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\drawStepArrow{}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 3cm, auto, thick,scale=\CrossSectionOnly, every node/.style={transform shape}]
		\input{tikz_process_steps/sti.silicon_etch.b.tex}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Trench etching}
\end{figure}

Typically it's a good approach to set the parameters of the DRIE recipe to an amount of cycles which will result in a depth of roughly 5 microns.

\subsection{LTO/PSG+CMP}

Now we trenches need to be filled up with LTO/PSG and planarized until we meet a sufficiently low height differential between the oxide surface and the silicon surface.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 3cm, auto, thick,scale=\CrossSectionOnly, every node/.style={transform shape}]
		\input{tikz_process_steps/sti.resist_removal.b.tex}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\drawStepArrow{}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 3cm, auto, thick,scale=\CrossSectionOnly, every node/.style={transform shape}]
		\input{tikz_process_steps/sti.lto.b.tex}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{After CMP}
\end{figure}

This process loop until a height differential below 200nm is being reached turned out to be a good approach. We start counting LTO+CMP steps at 1:
\begin{itemize}
\item Deposit $\frac{5\mu}{2^{step-1}}$ LTO/PSG
\item CMP around $\frac{5\mu}{2^{step-1}}$ LTO/PSG
\item Clean in hot ammonia
\item Put into DI:HF (50:1) for one or two minutes, until silicon surface on the islands is free of LTO/PSG 
\item Repeat until height differential lower than 200nm
\end{itemize}
