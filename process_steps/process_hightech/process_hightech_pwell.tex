\subsection{P-well}\label{pwell_chapter}

In order to build CMOS on the same substrate, a P-well is required for building the complementary N-channel transistor for a NFET+PFET logic circuitry.

The cross section as well as the top view of the targeted geometry are shown in \autoref{nwell_target}

The "P-well" will serve us as an island of higher p-doped substrate within the slightly p-doped basis substrate and gives us more flexibility with suppliers, because we can just adjust the doping in case the concentration might be different with another supplier.

The P-dopant concentration of our prime grade, p-type, single side polished, four inch wafers is between $8.76 \cdot 10^{14} \frac{1}{cm^3}$ and $5.23 \cdot 10^{14} \frac{1}{cm^3}$

This means we need a dose of $1.93\times10^{12}cm^{-2}$ Boron atoms at 40 keV.

The concentration will need adjustment when the used substrate has different properties!

After the implantation we perform a drive-in in inert atmosphere at $1050\degreesC$ for two hours and don't have to worry about the substrate anymore.
